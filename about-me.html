            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
              Hey, I'm Finley! I'm an aspiring visual designer diving headfirst
              into the world of UX/UI. I love making things that not only look
              good but also make sense for people. Think of me as someone who
              brings a real, honest approach to problem-solving – I put in the
              work and I care about getting it right. I'm all about teamwork,
              thinking critically, and putting users first. Empathy and clear
              communication are my superpowers, and I always want to create
              designs that inspire and make a positive impact.

            <h2>What Guides My Creative Process</h2>

            <h3>Designing for People</h3>
            <p>
              I’m passionate about creating simple, intuitive designs that solve
              real problems and make life easier.
            </p>

            <h3>Collaboration is Key</h3>
            <p>
              I thrive on teamwork and feedback—it helps me refine ideas and
              create better solutions.
            </p>

            <h3>To Innovate</h3>
            <p>
              I believe great design comes from testing, tweaking, and improving
              until it works beautifully.
            </p>

            <h3>Creativity with Purpose</h3>
            <p>
              I balance creativity and functionality to create experiences that
              look great and truly deliver.
