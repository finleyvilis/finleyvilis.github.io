        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Role: UX/UI Designer</li>
          <li>Team: Independent Project</li>
          <li>Timeline: 4 weeks</li>
          <li>Tools: Figma, Adobe Illustrator</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As part of my typography class (IDX104), I created a responsive
          website design to showcase skills in typography and layout. The
          project criteria stated that to be successful, I would need to use 10 
          unique typefaces, interpret a good balance of layouts and grid system.
          I created The website "Floral Favourites", displaying unique layouts
          and style for each flower

        <h2>The Challange</h2>

        <p>
          <strong> Problem Statement:</strong>
          Creating a floral website that uses 10 unique typefaces requires
          balancing aesthetics with usability through cohesive typography,
          effective grids, and responsive layouts.  This project addresses these
          issues by developing a visually consistent website with intuitive
          navigation and custom UI icons, optimized for desktop and mobile.

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          A responsive website showcasing 10 of my favourite  flowers, designed
          to offer an engaging and informative user experience across desktop
          and mobile devices. The site features unique typography for each
          flower, a cohesive grid-based layout, custom UI icons and maintaining
          visual consistency with the floral theme.  This project demonstrates
          skills in layout design, typography, responsive web design, and icon
          creation, while balancing creativity with usability within a limited
          timeframe.

      <section class="casestudy-point">
        <h2>Research & Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          To begin, I researched floral websites, looking  at color, typography,
          and layout trends. I was particularly drawn to the use of grid systems
          to structure content, realizing breaking the grid creates visual
          emphasis. This later  informed my mood board, which featured soft
          pastel colors, elegant fonts, and high-quality imagery – all essential
          for capturing the personality of each flower.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I had to find fonts that show elegance and timelessness.</li>
          <li>Pastel colors show softness and calmness.</li>
          <li>
            High-quality imagery is essential for showcasing the beauty of
            flowers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>

        <h3>Content Development</h3>
        <p>
            I selected ten flowers based on their visual characteristics and symbolism. For each flower, I wrote and had Ai generated text that gave descriptive placeholder text highlighting its unique features while adhering to proper grammar and sentence structure as per the brief.

        <h3>Wire-framing & Layout Grids</h3>
        <p>
            Using low-fidelity wireframes, I planned the layout for both desktop (1000px wide) and mobile (375px wide). A 6-column grid system for desktop and a 5 column-grid system for mobile which created alignment across all pages while maintaining flexibility for breaking the grid layout.

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <p>
            Part of the criteria was to assign unique fonts to reflect the personality of each flower while maintaining consistency through a shared body font across all pages.

        <h3>Icon Creation</h3>
        <p>
            I designed eight custom UI icons using Adobe Illustrator and figma. Later picking five I felt suited and followed the same visual language as the website—rounded edges, clean lines.
        </p>

            <h3> Overall Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Balancing unique typography for each flower with overall consistency was challenging but resolved by using a shared body font across all pages.</li>
                <li>icons that were both visually appealing and functional across different screen sizes and contexts within the website.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ensure appropriate type size and corresponding leading is used and typographical hierarchy is used effectively to guide the reader through content.
